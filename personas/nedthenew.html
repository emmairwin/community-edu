label: New Contributor
persona_description: Ned is a junior-level employee, or recent graduate who feels connected to Mozilla's mission. He arrived in the community looking for opportunity to advance his existing skills, and to learn new ones.  Despite some initial uncertainty and frusration, he's made one or more small contributions which have given him new confidence and a sense of accomplishment. He's feeling excited and exploring. <br><br>Ned engages with some intensity in the beginning (a critical time for retaining his participation), he’s willing to read a few wikis, post questions and expects to lose time to learning as he goes.  Having said that, early wins are important to Ned’s vision for his continued Participation.
